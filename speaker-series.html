                Long-Term Forecasting of Correlated Multiple Time Series with Anomalies - An AutoML
                Approach
              </h2>
              <p>Speaker: Morgan Wang.</p>
              <p>
                Time series forecasting is crucial in both statistical learning (SL) and machine
                learning (ML), with applications across sectors such as supply chain and financial
                management. Accurate long-term forecasting is essential for optimizing resource
                allocation, enhancing decision-making processes, and addressing the dynamic
                challenges posed by evolving data trends and seasonality over time. Recent
                advancements in time series forecasting, particularly through Automated Machine
                Learning (AutoML), have shown significant effectiveness in both short-term and
                long-term forecasting of univariate and bivariate time series. This effectiveness is
                even more pronounced in multivariate time series forecasting. This presentation will
                explore these advancements, emphasizing the superior accuracy of AutoML approaches
                compared to traditional statistical methods like Autoregressive Integrated Moving
                Average (ARIMA) and Vector Autoregression (VAR), especially in scenarios where
                seasonality and trends have shifted over time. Moreover, the approach presented
                leverages machine learning to automate the entire analysis process, enabling
                researchers and data scientists without specialized training in time series
                forecasting to effectively utilize this method.

                Overperception of moral outrage in online social networks inflates beliefs about
                intergroup hostility
              </h2>
              <p>Speaker: William J. Brady.</p>
              <p>
                As individuals and political leaders increasingly take to online networks for
                social interactions, it is important to understand how the platforms that host them
                can shape social knowledge of morality and politics. In this work, I propose that
                features of social media environments including dysfunctional human-algorithm
                interactions may be conducive to misperceptions of moral emotions at the individual
                and group level with consequences for intergroup conflict. Utilizing a Twitter field
                survey, I measured authors’ outrage in real time and compared author reports to
                judgments made by observers. I find that social media users tend to overperceive
                moral outrage expression at the individual-level, inferring more intense outrage
                experiences from messages than the authors of those messages themselves actually
                report. Individual-level overperceptions were also associated with greater social
                media use to learn about politics. Follow-up experiments find that these individual
                misperceptions cause misperceptions of collective outrage, which also amplifies
                perceptions of hostile communication norms, group affective polarization and
                ideological extremity. Together, these results highlight how individual-level
                misperceptions of online emotions produce collective misperceptions that have the
                potential to exacerbate intergroup conflict. I end with considerations for content
                moderation on digital social platforms.
